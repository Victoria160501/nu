    <h3>Overview of the Iban Ethnic Group:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Iban, traditionally known as Sea Dayaks, are one of the most populous and significant indigenous groups in Sarawak, Malaysia. This ethnic group has a rich cultural heritage and has played a crucial role in the history and development of the region.</li>
        <li>The Iban predominantly settle along Sarawak's major rivers, such as the Rajang, Batang Ai, and Baram rivers. These rivers are vital for their daily lives, providing water for drinking, cooking, and agriculture, as well as serving as transportation routes. The fertile riverbanks offer ideal conditions for their traditional farming practices.</li>
        <li>Historically, the Iban were known for their headhunting practices, which were integral to their warfare and spiritual rituals. Headhunting was believed to bring spiritual benefits and was a way to honor their ancestors. It also played a role in asserting dominance and deterring enemy tribes. Though headhunting is no longer practiced, it remains a significant part of their cultural identity and history.</li>
        <li>The Iban are renowned for their exceptional craftsmanship, particularly in weaving and woodcarving. Their traditional textiles, known as pua kumbu, are intricately woven with symbolic designs and are highly valued. Woodcarving is another significant skill, with carvings often depicting spiritual symbols and stories from their folklore. These crafts are not only artistic expressions but also hold cultural and spiritual significance.</li>
        <li>Iban society is organized around communal living in longhouses, known locally as rumah panjai. These longhouses are large, shared dwellings that accommodate multiple families. Each family has its own apartment-like space, while common areas are shared by all residents. This communal living fosters a strong sense of community, collective identity, and mutual support among the Iban people. The longhouse is more than a residence; it is the center of social, cultural, and political life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Historical Background and Migration to Sarawak:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The migration and settlement of the Iban people in Sarawak is a tale of resilience, adaptation, and cultural preservation.</li>
        <li>The Iban are believed to have migrated from the Kapuas River basin in Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo, to Sarawak over several centuries. Significant migrations occurred around the 15th century. This migration was motivated by the search for fertile land suitable for their traditional shifting cultivation (paddy farming) and to escape conflicts and pressures from other ethnic groups in their original areas.</li>
        <li>The migration was driven by the need to find new farming lands and the allure of fertile river valleys. The Iban practiced shifting cultivation, which requires large areas of land to rotate crops and maintain soil fertility. Additionally, the Iban sought to escape conflicts with other groups in Kalimantan, seeking a more peaceful and prosperous life in Sarawak.</li>
        <li>Upon arriving in Sarawak, the Iban established settlements along the major rivers. Rivers were essential for transportation, agriculture, and daily living. The fertile riverbanks provided ideal conditions for their traditional farming practices. Over time, the Iban adapted to the local environment, forming harmonious relationships with other indigenous and non-indigenous groups. This interaction led to a cultural exchange, influencing and being influenced by other communities.</li>

    <h3>Traditional Iban Society</h3>

    <h4>Social Structure and Hierarchy</h4>

    <p>The traditional Iban social structure is deeply rooted in the longhouse community, which serves as the fundamental unit of Iban society. This structure is not only a reflection of their way of life but also a crucial aspect of their cultural identity.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Longhouse Community:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Iban live in communal longhouses, known as <em>rumah panjai</em>. Each longhouse functions as a single extended family, with multiple nuclear families residing under one roof. This communal living fosters a strong sense of unity, cooperation, and mutual support among the Iban people. The longhouse is both a physical structure and a symbol of social and cultural cohesion.</li>
                <li>The layout of a longhouse typically includes individual family rooms (bilik) along a central corridor (ruai), where communal activities take place. The <em>ruai</em> serves as the social and ceremonial space, hosting gatherings, festivals, and daily interactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Tuai Rumah (Headman):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The tuai rumah is the head of the longhouse and plays a pivotal role in the community. This position is usually held by a respected elder who is responsible for the overall administration of the longhouse. The tuai rumahâ€™s duties include:</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> The tuai rumah acts as a mediator in disputes within the community, ensuring harmony and adherence to customary laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Ritual Leadership:</strong> The headman leads important rituals and ceremonies, which are integral to the Iban's spiritual life and cultural traditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Custodian of Adat:</strong> The tuai rumah maintains and enforces <em>adat</em> (customary laws), which govern the social and moral conduct of the community. These laws cover various aspects of life, from marriage and inheritance to agricultural practices and social behavior.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Social Roles and Responsibilities:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Iban social hierarchy includes a variety of roles, each contributing to the community's welfare and cultural preservation:</li>
                <li><strong>Warriors (Pengayau):</strong> Historically, Iban warriors were esteemed for their bravery in headhunting raids, which were believed to bring spiritual benefits and honor to their families. Although headhunting is no longer practiced, the valor of warriors is still celebrated in Iban folklore and rituals.</li>
                <li><strong>Hunters:</strong> Skilled in tracking and hunting wildlife, hunters provide essential protein for the community and participate in rituals that honor the spirits of the forest and animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Farmers:</strong> Agriculture, particularly shifting cultivation (paddy farming), is the backbone of Iban subsistence. Farmers are responsible for planting, harvesting, and maintaining rice fields, which are central to Iban life and cultural festivals like Gawai Dayak.</li>
                <li><strong>Craftsmen:</strong> Renowned for their craftsmanship, Iban artisans create intricate weavings, woodcarvings, and beadwork. These crafts are not only functional but also carry deep cultural and spiritual significance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Leadership and Merit:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Leadership roles within the Iban community are often hereditary, passed down through generations within a family line. However, individual merit also plays a significant role in leadership selection. Attributes such as bravery in warfare, wisdom in decision-making, and the ability to maintain social harmony can elevate an individual to a leadership position, regardless of lineage.</li>
                <li>This blend of hereditary and merit-based leadership ensures that the most capable individuals guide the community, preserving traditional values while adapting to changing circumstances.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary, the traditional Iban society is a well-structured and cohesive community centered around the longhouse and guided by the tuai rumah. The intricate social hierarchy, with its various roles and responsibilities, reflects the Iban's commitment to communal living, cultural preservation, and adaptability.</p>
